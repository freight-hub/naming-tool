# naming-tool
Very simple go binary outputting a random name.  Used for temp deployments.

This is just a wrapper on the great and handy [moniker](https://github.com/technosophos/moniker) library, the same one used by helm.

It just outputs a random name from the list in descriptor-animal format.

Opensource because why not.  Also makes it easier to download from github in CI pipelines.
